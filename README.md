This program is comprised of multiple functions completing different tasks.
The first Function named ReverseArray reverses the elements of an array. after the array has been reversed, main will print the elements in the reversed arrays.

The second function named HasBalancedParenthesis takes a string determines if the phrase has balanced parenthesis and returns either true or false. If true is returned main will print to console "Has Balanced Parenthesis!" else it will print to console "Does not have Balanced Parenthesis".

The third and fourth functions are similar. InXish takes in a phrase and word and determines if the given phrase contains the said word in order. For instance for the function InDogish, a phrase is passed into the function and then passed into InXish along with the word dog. InXish will check the given phrase and if "dog" is found within the string in order. Both InDogish and InXish return bool statements if true is returned then main will print to console either "Is In Dogish" or "Is In Xish".

All functions were required to use O(1) or constant space!
